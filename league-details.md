## H2H EACH CATEGORY SCORING
This year were going H2H Categories! Go head-to-head with one opponent each week, earning a win or loss for each stat category.

What is H2H?
* H2H Each Category is the most common type of head-to-head play in fantasy baseball. It allows you to select the "X" number of statistical categories. For each scoring period, team totals are accumulated and a win, loss or tie is credited in each category based on the matchup results (i.e. 6-3-1 in a 10 category league).
