# Don't Leave Us, Vin!

## Can't be WILD forever, right?
"How can WILD (W8) be stopped?", you may be asking yourself. Well, I have a theory. Two words: Front Office. WILD has been busy swimming laps in the Free Agent pool. To date, he has made 66 moves.  66! He's making about 5 acquisitions per week.

If you want a shot at adorning his streak with a shiny L,  don't be afraid to switch up your roster for the week's top sluggers/pitchers. Take a look below, win streak began in Week 5

Is there a correlation between the number of moves and winning? I'll let you decide.

## West is having a party
We've finally reached a clear divide. West won't quit with the high scores, although they let up a bit last week, and all their winning. To my fellow East-siders, don't give up, there is still a chance we can reach the the left of that graph and claim more spots in the playoffs.

## Pennant Race
Now that we are past the halfway point, it's time to keep a closer eye on the Projected Playoff Matchup. Top 4 teams with the most wins will advance. As of today, the following are in, while the rest will have consolation matches
