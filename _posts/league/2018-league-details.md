# League Details

## OPENING DAY!
2018 Major League Baseball regular season will open on the earliest day ever on Thursday, March 29, and will feature every team playing on the same day. EVERY TEAM. SAME DAY. It's the first full slate of games since 1968. Whoa! source

## DRAFT REMINDER
Live draft is Wednesday at 6p. For those on the move, you can draft straight from ESPN Fantasy App. Busy during draft? Make sure to set your Auto-pick strategy from your team page.
Seattle folks, you're welcome to come over to Casa de la Commish anytime after 5p.

## LEAGUE MANAGEMENT & RECAPS
Last season was definitely not up to par with updates or management (we won't talk about roster snafu), and because of this I've enlisted the help of CAPP, aka Sean, to help manage, co-commish if you will, this season. If there is any opposition holler at me. I've also asked a few others to help with recaps to keep us all engaged.

## TEAMS & DIVISIONS
This season we dropped from 12 to 10 teams, which means we will change back to 2 divisions. Divisions are split in order of 2017 standings e.g. #1 team goes west, #2 goes east, #3 goes west, etc.

## SCORING
Changes have been made to encourage trading and create a balance between batters and pitchers. Scoring has been adjusted to boost points for batters and defensive players, and pitchers scores are aimed to reward for quality vs quantity.

## ROSTERS
Same as above - in an effort to prevent bowling each other with pitchers alone, changes to roster have been made.
Roster changes:
Roster size: 30 (LY  36)
Starting Pitchers: 4; limit 7 (LY 6 starters; limit: did not exist)
Bench: 10 (LY 12)

## TRADES
To encourage trading among ourselves, Trade Review Period has been removed. You can trade with another team and see trade in affect within day. Trade Review Period will revert back to 1 day holding period ~September 18th prior to playoffs to avoid giving players away to other teams... not saying anyone would do such a horrendous thing, but we won't take chances.

## LEAGUE CHAT
I don't know about you, but I'd like to talk more smack this season. If you feel the same way, please join me on Telegram where you can dish and be dished. Mostly, it'll be a great way to share baseball news, fun facts, bloopers, and discuss group events other than email threads or side conversations.
What is Telegram? It's a free messaging app
Why Telegram over, say, Hangouts or What's App? Three things: Not Facebook linked, Desktop app, Gifs. Hangouts is limiting and What's App is ok, but I don't like it. Totally biased.
Cool features? Link previews and Mute option if it gets out of control during work day
Wow, sounds great! Where do I download?
App: iPhone - Android
Desktop:  Mac - Windows PC - Web

## TROPHY
It exists! Picture will be shared on Telegram via group - yes, this is a tactic to get you to join, so see you in the group chat!
