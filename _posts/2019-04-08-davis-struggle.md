If you paid any attention to anything baseball you would have found a few of your prized draft picks adorned with an `IL 10` or worse.  At least no one earned their injuries on a dirt bike this year. Only `Readytowinagain` and `Warren` came out with an open IL spot on their roster. Congrats?

Also, Chris Davis is having the [toughest of starts.](http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26474373/what-need-know-chris-davis-0-49-streak). So no matter how poorly you scored, just remember, it's not 0 - 44.

## Sea to Shining Sea MVP
Leading the pack with an impressive 10-3 win and swimming laps in the free agent pool - `Good King Wenceslas`!  Heat was in the very sod… twas.

Although the wins were enough to boost Good King to top of the ranks, OBP and pitching stats should give the next opponent hope of moving up.

## Matchup Highlights

### Smitha (8) v Balking Dead (3)
At first glance this match may look like a regular schooling of sorts, but look at the margin. Dear. Lord. It’s a miracle there wasn’t a sweep. Brace yourself `Warren`, because your next matchup won’t be as calm as your last.

### King in the East? (4) vs Mad Bummer (7)
What started off as a slaughter turned out to be a close matchup.  Marred by IL it’s no wonder both teams were moving in transactions.

### Oh Oh Oh Tani (2nd) vs Larry Bernandez (9th)
If this was a bike race instead of a fantasy baseball matchup the score would have been much closer. For a first timer, you’re doing alright, `Larry`. Keep it up and go for the W in Matchup numero dos.

### Participation Ribbons
* `Team Has No Name` (10) - let’s chock the last matchup to a fluke. Hopefully next matchup right-sets all your stats.
* `Readytowinagain` (5) - your last matchup was a walk in the park, don’t expect the same against Good King.
* `Warren` (6) - your next opponent has a great roster, manage the hell out of yours and try to keep up.
