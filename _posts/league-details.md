## SCORING
This year were going Roto! We'll compete against your whole league all season long, trying to rank the highest in each stat category.

What is Roto?
* Rotisserie, or "Roto," is the most common way to play fantasy baseball. In this scoring type, teams are ranked from first to last in each statistical category. Points are then awarded according to the order in each category and totaled to determine an overall score and league rank.

## TRADES
To encourage trading among ourselves, Trade Review Period has been removed. You can trade with another team and see trade in affect within day.

## LEAGUE CHAT
League chat will be hosted on Telegram, where you can dish and be dished. Mostly, it'll be a great way to share baseball news, fun facts, bloopers, and discuss group events other than email threads or side conversations.

> What is Telegram? It's a free messaging app.<br>
> Why Telegram over, say, Hangouts or What's App?
- Not  What's App and therefore not Facebook
- Desktop app and Gifs
- Hangouts is limiting
>
> Cool features? Link previews and Mute option if it gets too noisy.
